## 🔍 Potential Future Blockers (Watch List)

### **1. Vercel AI SDK Rate Limits**

- **Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Could slow computer vision development in Phase 2
- **Probability**: Medium - Unknown until testing begins
- **Description**: GPT-4 Vision API has rate limits that may be restrictive during development
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Slow response times from AI endpoints
  - Rate limit errors during testing
  - High API costs during development
- **Mitigation Plan**:
  - Monitor API usage during Phase 2 development
  - Implement intelligent caching for similar images
  - Consider upgrading to paid tier if needed
  - Prepare mock responses for development testing
- **Owner**: Agent working on Phase 2 (Computer Vision)
- **Timeline**: Monitor starting Week 5-6

### **2. Mobile Camera API Compatibility**

- **Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Could affect mobile user experience
- **Probability**: Low-Medium - Modern browsers generally support WebRTC
- **Description**: Older mobile browsers may not support camera access APIs
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Camera permission failures on testing devices
  - Poor image quality from browser camera
  - Inconsistent behavior across device types
- **Mitigation Plan**:
  - Test on multiple devices and browsers early
  - Implement progressive enhancement with fallbacks
  - Consider native app wrapper if needed
  - Document supported browser versions
- **Owner**: Agent working on Phase 3 (UI Development)
- **Timeline**: Monitor starting Week 7-8

### **3. GPT-4 Vision Analysis Accuracy**

- **Impact**: 🔴 HIGH - Core feature depends on accurate color analysis
- **Probability**: Medium - Unknown until real-world testing
- **Description**: AI may not achieve target 95% accuracy for test strip color analysis
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Confidence scores consistently below 80%
  - User feedback indicating inaccurate results
  - High variance in results for identical strips
- **Mitigation Plan**:
  - Extensive testing with controlled test strip dataset
  - Professional lab validation for accuracy benchmarking
  - Multiple prompt strategies for difficult cases
  - Graceful fallback to manual entry
- **Owner**: Agent working on Phase 2 (Computer Vision)
- **Timeline**: Critical validation in Week 5-6

### **4. Performance Requirements Under Load**

- **Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Could affect user experience at scale
- **Probability**: Low - Vercel platform handles scaling well
- **Description**: AI processing time may exceed 5-second target under load
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Response times increasing during testing
  - Vercel function timeouts
  - Poor performance metrics in monitoring
- **Mitigation Plan**:
  - Load testing before public launch
  - Edge function optimization
  - Caching strategies for common analysis
  - Auto-scaling configuration
- **Owner**: Agent working on performance optimization
- **Timeline**: Monitor starting Week 9-10 (QA phase)

## 📊 Blocker Impact Assessment

### **Current Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

- No active blockers preventing immediate development
- All potential issues have mitigation strategies
- Specification phase completed successfully without major issues

### **Phase Readiness Assessment**

- **Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: ✅ Ready to proceed
- **Phase 2 (Computer Vision)**: 🟡 Monitor AI accuracy concerns
- **Phase 3 (UI Development)**: 🟡 Monitor mobile compatibility
- **Phase 4+ (Launch)**: ⏳ Too early to assess

---

## 🎯 Monitoring & Prevention

### **Early Warning System**

- Weekly risk assessment during agent handoffs
- Performance monitoring once systems are deployed
- User feedback collection during beta testing
- Regular review of API usage and costs

### **Escalation Process**

1. **Agent Level**: Document issue and attempt resolution
2. **Project Level**: Update blocker status if unresolvable in session
3. **Strategic Level**: Consider scope or timeline adjustments
4. **External**: Seek expert consultation or vendor support

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

- **Technical Risks**: Multiple fallback options, extensive testing
- **Performance Risks**: Monitoring, caching, optimization
- **Vendor Risks**: Avoid over-dependence, maintain alternatives
- **Timeline Risks**: Built-in buffers, flexible scope
