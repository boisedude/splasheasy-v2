## üìã Preservation Workflows

### **During Active Development**

#### **Real-Time Knowledge Capture**
```markdown
While Coding:
- Document why decisions are made, not just what was decided
- Capture alternative approaches that were considered
- Note performance observations and user experience insights
- Record any surprising discoveries or "aha!" moments

Session Updates:
- Update decision log with significant architectural choices
- Document patterns that work well for future reuse
- Capture integration challenges and their solutions
- Note any deviations from original plans and why
```

#### **End-of-Session Documentation**
```markdown
Before Handoff:
1. Update DECISION_LOG.md with any new architectural choices
2. Document successful patterns in system-design.md
3. Update technical-requirements.md if requirements evolved
4. Capture lessons learned in session summary
```

### **Knowledge Review Cycles**

#### **Weekly Knowledge Audit**
```markdown
Every Friday (End of Week):
- Review all session logs from the week
- Extract recurring themes and insights
- Update architecture documentation with discoveries  
- Consolidate scattered decisions into decision log
- Identify knowledge gaps that need attention
```

#### **Phase Transition Reviews**
```markdown
At End of Each Phase:
- Comprehensive review of all decisions made
- Update system architecture based on implementation learnings
- Document performance benchmarks and user feedback
- Create "lessons learned" summary for the phase
- Update requirements based on implementation reality
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Knowledge Organization System

### **Decision Documentation Standards**

#### **Good Decision Documentation**
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLE:

## Decision: Use Vercel AI SDK for Computer Vision
- **Date**: 2025-01-06
- **Context**: Need to analyze test strip colors with high accuracy
- **Problem**: Traditional computer vision is complex and brittle
- **Decision**: Use GPT-4 Vision via Vercel AI SDK with structured outputs
- **Rationale**: 
  - Proven accuracy for color analysis tasks
  - No need to train custom models (saves months)
  - Structured outputs eliminate parsing complexity
  - Built-in confidence scoring
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Custom ML model: Rejected due to time/complexity
  - Traditional CV: Rejected due to brittleness
  - Third-party service: Rejected due to integration complexity
- **Implementation Impact**: Enables 5-second analysis target
- **Cost Impact**: ~$0.05 per analysis, acceptable for premium feature
- **Risks Mitigated**: Rate limiting addressed with caching strategy
```

#### **Poor Decision Documentation**
```markdown
‚ùå BAD EXAMPLE:

Changed to use AI for image analysis because it's better.
```

### **Architectural Knowledge Standards**

#### **Good Architecture Documentation**
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLE:

## Component: Water Test Analysis Pipeline
- **Purpose**: Transform user images into actionable water chemistry insights
- **Architecture Decision**: Multi-stage pipeline with validation
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Image preprocessing (quality, orientation)
  2. AI analysis with GPT-4 Vision
  3. Confidence scoring and validation
  4. Fallback to manual entry if confidence < 80%
- **Performance**: Target <5 seconds end-to-end
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Testing Strategy**: Controlled dataset + real-world validation
- **Lessons Learned**: Image quality preprocessing is critical for accuracy
```

### **User Insight Documentation**

#### **Capturing User Feedback**
```markdown
## User Insight: Test Strip Alignment Challenges
- **Date**: 2025-01-15 (Beta testing)
- **Source**: 5 user interviews + app analytics
- **Observation**: Users struggle to align strips with camera guide
- **Impact**: 40% of first attempts fail due to poor alignment
- **Root Cause**: Guide overlay too subtle, no real-time feedback
- **Solution Implemented**: Live alignment feedback with color coding
- **Result**: Alignment success rate increased to 85%
- **Pattern**: Users need immediate visual feedback for camera features
```

## üîç Knowledge Mining Techniques

### **Session Log Analysis**
```markdown
Monthly Review Process:
1. Scan all session logs for recurring themes
2. Extract common problems and their solutions  
3. Identify successful patterns worth standardizing
4. Document anti-patterns to avoid in future
5. Update architecture docs with proven approaches
```

### **Code Pattern Extraction**
```markdown
When Patterns Emerge:
1. Document the pattern in architecture docs
2. Create reusable code templates or utilities
3. Update coding standards to encourage the pattern
4. Share pattern in handoff notes for next agents
```

### **Performance Insight Capture**
```markdown
Continuous Monitoring:
1. Document all performance benchmarks achieved
2. Capture optimization techniques that worked
3. Note approaches that didn't improve performance
4. Update technical requirements with actual metrics
```

## üöÄ Knowledge Application Workflows

### **For New Agents**

#### **Knowledge Loading Protocol**
```markdown
Agent Onboarding (5 minutes):
1. Read PROJECT_STATUS.md for current state
2. Scan DECISION_LOG.md for key architectural choices
3. Review LAST_SESSION_SUMMARY.md for recent insights
4. Check architecture docs for established patterns
5. Identify any knowledge gaps that need filling
```

#### **Building on Previous Knowledge**

- Document negative results (what didn't work)
- Capture user feedback verbatim when possible
- Record performance measurements and benchmarks
- Note integration challenges and their solutions
```

#### **Knowledge Sharing**
```markdown
Cross-Session Learning:
