## 📋 Immediate Next Steps for Incoming Agent

### **CRITICAL Actions (Do First)**
1. **Initialize Vercel Project**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/d/Projects/SplashEasy-V2
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir
   ```

2. **Set Up Authentication**
   - Create Clerk account and configure keys
   - Implement authentication flow with Next.js 15 App Router
   - Test sign-up/sign-in functionality

3. **Database Setup**
   - Create Vercel Postgres database
   - Implement 4-table schema from architecture docs
   - Set up Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries

### **Expected Session Outcome**
- Working Next.js 15 application deployed to Vercel
- User authentication functional with Clerk
- Database schema implemented and tested
- Basic API routes structure in place

## 🎨 Key Insights & Context for Next Agent

### **Project Vision**
This is rebuilding SplashEasy as V2 with AI-powered computer vision as the core differentiator. Users will photograph test strips and get instant, accurate water analysis - eliminating the guesswork and complexity of traditional water testing.

### **Technology Philosophy**
- **AI-First**: Computer vision is not a feature, it's the core interaction paradigm
- **Mobile-Native**: PWA delivering app-like experience without app store friction
- **Speed-Obsessed**: Every decision prioritizes rapid development and user experience
- **Vendor-Leveraged**: Use best-in-class services (Vercel, Clerk, GPT-4) rather than building custom

### **Development Strategy**
- Start with solid foundation (Phase 1) before adding AI magic (Phase 2)
- Use v0.dev for rapid UI generation in Phase 3
- Focus on MVP features, defer complex functionality
- Maintain rapid iteration with comprehensive documentation

---

## 💡 Important Context & Warnings

### **Critical Context to Remember**
- **This is a complete rebuild**, not an iteration of the existing Beta
- **Computer vision comes in Phase 2**, don't attempt it in Phase 1
- **Mobile-first approach** - every decision should prioritize mobile experience
- **Documentation is comprehensive** - reference it frequently for implementation details

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Don't over-engineer the initial implementation
- Don't try to implement all Beta features at once
- Don't skip the database setup - everything depends on solid data layer
- Don't neglect TypeScript - maintain type safety from the start

### **Success Criteria Reminders**
- Phase 1 success = working app with auth, database, and basic functionality
- Focus on core infrastructure, not fancy features yet
- Keep the computer vision goal in mind, but build the foundation first
