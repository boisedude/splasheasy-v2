## üîÑ Work Log

### **09:00 - Project Vision & Requirements Analysis**
- ‚úÖ Analyzed existing SplashEasy Beta for insights and requirements
- ‚úÖ Identified key user pain points with manual color matching
- ‚úÖ Defined core value proposition: "Take a photo, get expert results in 3 seconds"
- ‚úÖ Established computer vision as primary differentiator

**Key Insight**: Existing Beta has valuable domain knowledge but is over-engineered with 29 migrations and 15+ tables. V2 should be complete rebuild focusing on core value.

### **10:00 - Technology Stack Selection**
**Objective**: Choose optimal technology foundation for AI-first application
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Major Decision**: Vercel platform with Next.js 15 + GPT-4 Vision
**Rationale**: 
- Vercel AI SDK provides best-in-class GPT-4 Vision integration
- Edge functions enable global performance for AI processing
- Next.js 15 App Router perfect for PWA requirements
- Clerk provides premium auth components (2-day setup vs 2-week custom)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Railway + separate AI: More complex integration, less optimized
- AWS + custom ML: Over-engineered for MVP, months of training
- Traditional computer vision: Brittle, complex, uncertain accuracy

**Technical Stack Finalized**:
- Platform: Vercel (hosting, AI SDK, edge functions, database)
- Framework: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + App Router
- Database: Vercel Postgres (simplified 4-table schema)
- Authentication: Clerk (premium components)
- AI: GPT-4 Vision via Vercel AI SDK
- UI: v0.dev generation + shadcn/ui components
