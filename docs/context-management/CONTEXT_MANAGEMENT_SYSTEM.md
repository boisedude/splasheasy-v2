# Context Management System
**SplashEasy V2 - Agent Handoff & Knowledge Continuity Framework**

---

## 🎯 System Overview

This context management system ensures seamless knowledge transfer between AI agents throughout the SplashEasy V2 development process. Each agent can quickly understand the current project state, pick up where the previous agent left off, and document their contributions for future agents.

## 📋 Core Principles

### 1. **Rapid Agent Onboarding**
- New agents should understand project context within 2-3 minutes
- Clear current status and immediate next actions
- Access to all critical decisions and rationale

### 2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Every agent session documents what was accomplished
- Decisions made and reasoning behind them
- Blockers encountered and resolution paths

### 3. **Continuous Project State**
- Always-current project status tracking
- Next actions clearly prioritized and scoped
- Dependencies and prerequisites identified

### 4. **Knowledge Preservation**
- Critical insights and learnings captured
- Code patterns and architectural decisions documented
- User feedback and iteration history maintained

## 🔄 Agent Workflow Process

### **INCOMING AGENT CHECKLIST**

#### 1. Quick Context Loading (5 minutes)
```
□ Read PROJECT_STATUS.md (current state)
□ Review LAST_SESSION_SUMMARY.md (previous work)
□ Check NEXT_ACTIONS.md (immediate priorities)
□ Scan CURRENT_BLOCKERS.md (known issues)
□ Review DECISION_LOG.md (key decisions made)
```

#### 2. Status Verification (2 minutes)
```
□ Verify project still builds/runs
□ Check all links and references work
□ Confirm environment setup is current
□ Test key functionality if applicable
```

#### 3. Work Session Initialization (1 minute)
```
□ Create new session log: YYYY-MM-DD-session-N.md
□ Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with session start
□ Acknowledge receipt of handoff in session log
```

### **OUTGOING AGENT CHECKLIST**

#### 1. Work Documentation (5 minutes)
```
□ Complete session summary with all changes made
□ Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with current state
□ Update NEXT_ACTIONS.md with priorities and context
□ Document any new blockers in CURRENT_BLOCKERS.md

```

#### 2. Knowledge Transfer Preparation (3 minutes)
```
□ Highlight critical information for next agent
□ Create handoff notes with context and warnings

□ Test that documented instructions work
```

#### 3. Clean Handoff (2 minutes)
```
□ Archive completed session log
□ Ensure all file paths are absolute and correct
□ Leave project in stable, documented state
□ Create clear transition notes for next agent
```

## 📊 Status Tracking System

### **Project Health Dashboard**

Each status file uses standardized health indicators:

```markdown
## Overall Status: 🟢 HEALTHY | 🟡 CAUTION | 🔴 BLOCKED

### Phase Progress
- ✅ Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Complete)
- 🔄 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (In Progress - 60%)
- ⏳ Phase 2: Computer Vision (Pending)
- ⏳ Phase 3: User Interface (Pending)

### Critical Metrics
- Documentation: ✅ Complete (2,692 lines)
- Development Environment: 🟡 Partial Setup
- Core Features: 🔴 Not Started
- Testing Framework: ⏳ Pending
```

### **Priority Classification**

All tasks and actions use consistent priority labels:

- **🔥 CRITICAL**: Blocking all other work, must resolve immediately
- **⚡ HIGH**: Affects milestone delivery, address within 24 hours
- **📋 MEDIUM**: Important but not urgent, complete within sprint
- **💡 LOW**: Nice to have, address when time permits
- **🧊 FROZEN**: Deferred to future phase or cancelled

## 🔄 Agent Handoff Protocols

### **Smooth Handoff (Normal Case)**
```
Previous Agent Session End:
1. Completes current task or reaches logical stopping point
2. Documents all work in session log with clear summary
3. Updates all status files with current state
4. Creates transition notes with context for next agent
5. Leaves project in stable, runnable state

New Agent Session Start:  
1. Reviews all status files and transition notes
2. Verifies project state and runs basic tests
3. Acknowledges handoff and begins new session log
4. Proceeds with documented next actions
```

### **Emergency Handoff (Context Window Full)**
```
Previous Agent (Last Actions):
1. Immediately document current state in emergency handoff
2. Prioritize critical context over completeness
3. Highlight exactly what was being worked on
4. Note any in-progress changes or uncommitted work
5. Mark URGENT items that need immediate attention

New Agent (First Actions):
1. Read emergency handoff notes first
2. Stabilize any in-progress work
3. Verify system is in working state
4. Complete or rollback any partial changes
5. Resume normal workflow once stable
```

### **Specialized Handoff (Domain Change)**
```
When switching between different work types:
- Development → Testing: Include code changes, test requirements
- Frontend → Backend: Note API changes, data flow impacts
- Architecture → Implementation: Highlight design decisions, constraints
- Planning → Development: Emphasize requirements, success criteria
```

## 💡 Best Practices & Guidelines

### **Documentation Standards**

#### 1. Always Use Absolute Paths
```markdown
❌ Bad:  "Check the config file in ../web/config"
✅ Good: "Check the config file at /mnt/d/Projects/SplashEasy-V2/web/config"
```

#### 2. Include Working Commands
```markdown
❌ Bad:  "Run the build command"
✅ Good: "Run: cd /mnt/d/Projects/SplashEasy-V2 && npm run build"
```

#### 3. Document Current State
```markdown
❌ Bad:  "Working on user authentication"
✅ Good: "Implementing Clerk auth integration - completed signup, working on session management, next: profile creation"
```

#### 4. Provide Context for Decisions
```markdown
❌ Bad:  "Changed database schema"
✅ Good: "Changed user table to include preferences JSONB field to avoid separate table - improves query performance and simplifies auth logic"
```

### **Session Management**

#### 1. Start Each Session with Status Check
- Verify last documented state matches reality
- Test that previous work is still functional
- Note any environmental changes or issues

#### 2. Work in Logical Chunks
- Complete discrete tasks that can be easily handed off
- Don't leave partially implemented features
- Always commit or document in-progress work

#### 3. Document Continuously  
- Update status files throughout session, not just at end
- Note important decisions and rationale as you make them
- Keep session log current so handoff can happen anytime

### **Communication Patterns**

#### 1. Status Updates
```markdown
## Status Update - 2025-01-08 14:30
- Completed: User authentication setup with Clerk
- Currently: Implementing database schema migrations  
- Next: API route structure and validation
- Blockers: None currently
- ETA: Database work complete by end of session
```

#### 2. Decision Documentation
```markdown
## Decision: Database Schema Approach
- Date: 2025-01-08
- Context: Need to simplify complex Beta schema
- Decision: Use 4 core tables instead of 15+
- Rationale: Reduces complexity, improves performance, easier maintenance
- Impact: Faster development, cleaner codebase
- Alternatives Considered: Keep existing schema (rejected - too complex)
```

#### 3. Blocker Escalation
```markdown
## Blocker: Vercel AI SDK Rate Limiting
- Impact: 🔴 CRITICAL - Blocks computer vision development
- Description: Hitting rate limits during testing
- Attempted Solutions: 
  - Implemented caching ❌ Still hitting limits
  - Reduced test frequency ❌ Insufficient for development
- Recommended Resolution: Upgrade to paid tier or implement mock responses
- Owner: Next agent working on AI integration
```
