## 🛠️ **Phase 2 Technical Architecture**

### **Authentication Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Visits] --> B{Authenticated?}
    B -->|No| C[Guest Mode Available]
    B -->|Yes| D[Dashboard]
    C --> E[Take Test]
    E --> F{Want to Save?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Signup/Login]
    F -->|No| H[Continue as Guest]
    G --> I[Convert Guest Data]
    I --> D
```

### **Data Persistence Strategy**
- **Guest Users**: Results stored in localStorage temporarily
- **Authenticated Users**: All data persisted to Supabase
- **Migration**: Guest data converted on account creation
- **Backup**: Regular automated backups of user data

### **Database Usage**
The existing schema is ready for Phase 2:
- `profiles` table for user accounts
- `units` table for pools/spas  
- `water_tests` table for test results
- `maintenance_reminders` table for reminders
